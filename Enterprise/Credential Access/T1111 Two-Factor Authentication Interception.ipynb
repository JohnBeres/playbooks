    "# T1111 Two-Factor Authentication Interception\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technique Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries may target two-factor authentication mechanisms, such as smart cards, to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources. Use of two or multi-factor authentication (2FA or MFA) is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a smart card is used for two-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. (Citation: Mandiant M Trends 2011)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes). (Citation: GCN RSA June 2011)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods of 2FA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception. Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors. (Citation: Operation Emmental)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technique Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting use of proxied smart card connections by an adversary may be difficult because it requires the token to be inserted into a system; thus it is more likely to be in use by a legitimate user and blend in with other network behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056), keylogging activity can take various forms but can may be detected via installation of a driver, setting a hook, or usage of particular API calls associated with polling to intercept keystrokes.\n",

    "- Depending on the technique used, it may be difficult to detect 2FA interception. If its SMS based, the attacker has several options from manipulating the \"Carrier\" into transferring the phone, to installing malware on the victim and intercepting the messages. The most common/known attacks rely on malware being installed with a \"keylogging\" functionality to intercept the incoming/outgoing (Phishing site simulating Bank). The most recent attack involved bypassing 2FA by compromising the server the authenticates users, then stealing the \"trusted auth key\" from the service. This allowed the attacker to create a \"valid token\" for the session causing the 2FA software not to prompt the user for a Pin.\n",

    "- Phishing is also a means to bypass 2FA through the use of a reverse proxy (Evilginx2 / Modlishka) and Man-in-the-middle communications between the victim and the legitimate site. Identifying this would require obtaining email logs and correlating multiple user logins within a short timeframe since the attacker will be proxying their connection through the same token. Depending on the Operational security of the attacker, you could potentially identify them if they do not select the appropriate VPN provider/location to spoof the originator. \n",
