                "Adversaries may “pass the ticket” using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.\n",

A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access. A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.(Citation: ADSecurity AD Kerberos Attacks)(Citation: GentilKiwi Pass the Ticket)\n",

                "- Adversary may have acquired a stolen ticket and used it for services and may have even renewed but never did the initial request. Looking for the account that signed the tickets is key for finding the depth of the compromise. In order to find this TTP, it is recommended that you have narrowed the time of the infection or specific IP's of interest due to the amount of Kerberos traffic on a Windows domain. Attackers will harvest TGTs and then use them on a different system. TGS requests or TGT renewals with a particular Account / Client pair that have no associated TGT request from that Account / Client pair. You would have to look at a TGS request or TGT renewal and then scan back the previous \"X\" hours to see if there was a TGT request that matches that user and computer.  \n",
