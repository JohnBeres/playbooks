                "Adversaries may “pass the hash” using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.\n",
                "\n",
                "When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.\n",
                "\n",
                "Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to \"overpass the hash.\" Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket. This ticket can then be used to perform [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003) attacks.(Citation: Stealthbits Overpass-the-Hash)\n",

                "- The adversary will utilize pass the hash (PtH) in order to laterally move around the network. This activity will be tipped by the Host operators as they will have better visibility into NTLM authentication and Successful/New logons. Close attention should be placed on the Domain controller and any administrator accounts accessing the DC.\n",
                "\n",
                "- After an adversary gains access to a host, one of the early stage actions will be to pull credentials to enable lateral movement and possible privilege escalation based on stored admin credentials. After gaining a foothold on one computer, APT 28 has been seen moving laterally through an organization by compromising additional computers to gain access to more data and high-value targets. APT 28 uses publicly available tools such as WinExe (a remote command-line execution tool) and Mimikatz (a Windows credential gathering tool) to move between computers via methods such as Pass the Hash (PtH). In 2015, Microsoft observed APT 28 using a customized version of Mimikatz that was recompiled with a privilege escalation exploit (CVE-2015-1701, addressed by Security Bulletin MS15-051) and stored captured credential information in a dedicated file, pi.log. The specific versions of windows the exploit has been known to compromise are Windows Server 2003, 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.\n",
