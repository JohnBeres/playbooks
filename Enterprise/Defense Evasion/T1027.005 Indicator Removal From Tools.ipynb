                "Adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed.

                "A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software.

The alerting system should be thoroughly investigated beyond that initial alert for activity that was not detected.
