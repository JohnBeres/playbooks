    "# T1218 Signed Binary Proxy Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technique Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed binaries. Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technique Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor processes and command-line parameters for signed binaries that may be used to proxy execution of malicious files. Compare recent invocations of signed binaries that may be used to proxy execution with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Legitimate programs used in suspicious ways, like msiexec.exe downloading an MSI file from the Internet, may be indicative of an intrusion. Correlate activity with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives that may be due to normal benign use by users and administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor for file activity (creations, downloads, modifications, etc.), especially for file types that are not typical within an environment and may be indicative of adversary activity.\n",

    "Host Data Collection Procedure 1.1 (using process start events):\n",
    "    1. Identify the common/present binaries on the network that typically run. (Known/observed LOLBins). For easy reading, one way to achieve insight into this is to create a        visualization in Kibana that identifies the count of any one of these executables. One can use a table that filters on if the process.name is one of the executables, or the gauges visualization, created for each process name. These should include one or more of the following:\n",
    "        hh.exe - Compiled HTML File (001)\n",
    "        control.exe - Control Panel (002)\n",
    "        cmstp.exe - CMSTP \n",
    "        installutil.exe - InstallUtil (004)\n",
    "        mshta.exe - Mshta (005)\n",
    "        msiexec.exe - Msiexec (007)\n",
    "        odbcconf.exe - Odbcconf (008)\n",
    "        regsvcs.exe - Regsvcs/Regasm (009)\n",
    "        regasm.exe - Regsvcs/Regasm (009)\n",
    "        regsvr32.exe - Regsvr32 (010)\n",
    "        rundll32.exe - Rundll32.exe (011)\n",
    "        verclsid.exe - Verclsid (012)\n",
    "    2. Perform a search to collect process_start events pertaining to the identified tools. This data can be queried from aggregated log data using Kibana (Kibana SOP), or other data aggregation platforms (list of familiar products with links to their SOPs–think Arcsight, Splunk, greylog, elasticsearch). It may also be available from host agents (page of familiar agents–again, linked to their SOPs) or from built-in command line logging.\n",
    "    3. Once the common/present binaries on the network are identified, begin parsing command line parameters for out of place structures. (Look at Known/observed LOLBins as well as EQL queries to get started.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "    1. Process start events pertaining to signed binaries is likely to be excessive. Look for common automation noise (wiki page on observed instances of noisy automation tools–e.g. tanium/sccm with suggestions about how to eliminate them) and eliminate them cautiously–you do not want to allow the adversary to hide in the exclusions.\n",
    "    2. Legitimate uses of these tools will be performed regularly and elimination of legitimate activity can be difficult.\n",
    "    3. One of the more common binaries abused are rundll32.exe and mshta.exe which will be presented below. This technique is obviously not only applicable to those.\n",
    "        a. Rundll32\n",
    "            i. Rundll32 enables the execution of native dynamic link libraries (DLL). Executing malicious code as a DLL allows an adversary to keep their malware from appearing directly in a process tree, as a directly executed EXE would.\n",
    "            ii. Beyond DLLs, Rundll32 can also execute JavaScript via the RunHtmlApplication function.\n",
    "            iii. Process command-line parameters are one of the most reliable sources to detect malicious use of Rundll32, since you need to pass command-line arguments for Rundll32 to execute.\n",
    "            iv. Since adversaries will try to use Rundll32 to load or write DLLs from world or user-writable folders, it makes sense to watch for rundll32.exe writing or loading files to or from any of the following locations:\n",

    "            v. some examples of process that usually won’t spawn Rundll32 might include: Microsoft Office products (e.g., winword.exe, excel.exe, msaccess.exe, etc.)\n",
    "                lsass.exe\n",

    "            vi. Establish a baseline on what activity is normal in MP environment and then write rules that will exclude the known activity. Keep in mind that these analytics will likely require a lot of tuning and monitoring to get to the point where they reliably produce high-fidelity alerting.\n",
    "        b. Mshta\n",
    "            i. Mshta can execute Windows Script Host code (VBScript and JScript) embedded within HTML in a network proxy-aware fashion.\n",
    "            ii. Monitoring process execution and command-line parameters will offer defenders visibility into many behaviors associated with malicious abuse of Mshta. Similarly, process lineage is also helpful for detecting adversary use of Mshta. At a minimum, collect parent-child process relationships, and, if possible, consider collecting information about “grandparent” relationships too.\n",
    "            iii. Defenders can build detection analytics for inline Mshta script execution around protocol handlers appearing in the command line. A specific detection example for this would be to look for the execution of mshta.exe in conjunction with a command line containing any of the protocol handlers that are relevant to Mshta: javascript, vbscript, or about, to name a few options:\n",
    "                vbscript\n",
    "                    CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run(\"notepad.exe\")(window.close)\n",
    "                javascript\n",
    "                    dxdkDS=\"kd54s\";djd3=newActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\");vs3skdk=\"dK3\"; sdfkl3=djd3. RegRead(\"HKCU\\\\software\\\\klkndk32lk\");esllnb3=\"3m3d\";eval(asdfkl2);dkn3=\"dks\";\n",
    "                 about\n",
    "                    about:<script>asdfs31=\"sdf2\";ssdf2=new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\");df2verew=\"sdfSDF\";ddlk3nj=ssdf2.RegRead(\"HKCU\\\\software\\\\asdf\\\\ asdfs\");asdfs=\"asdfasd\";eval(ddlk3nj);asdfsd=\"Tslkjs\";</script>\n",
    "            iv. Looking for mshta.exe launching powershell.exe could serve as high-fidelity detection analytic for a specific behavior.\n",
    "            v. Normal file-based execution of Mshta content is typically observed on disk and executes HTA content in files ending with the .hta file extension. Detection analytics targeting the execution of remotely hosted HTA content—either via URI or UNC path, from an alternate data stream, or from files without the .hta extension—can provide defenders with high-signal analytics.\n",
    "            vi. Detection analytics that are based on mshta.exe spawning untrusted or unsigned binaries can be especially prone to high numbers of false positives. This can be alleviated in parts by effectively tuning detection logic to account for related activity that is benign in MP environment."
