                "Adversaries may employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.\n\n",

                "- Depending on the encryption used, it may not be possible to identify what the traffic is doing. Even with SSL/TLS inspection capability, malware authors have been known (especially nation state actors) to employ multiple layers of encryption over their C2 channel. They may use legitimate HTTP/S traffic for communications but employ and custom crypto algorithm for the actual data before being sent over HTTP/S. The best way to \"defeat\" this or investigate it further requires reverse engineering of malware sample itself. Aside from the possibility of not being able to decrypt the data, there is also the probability of traffic \"impersonating\" legitimate users browsing websites making ja3 and other TLS inspection less effective.\n",
